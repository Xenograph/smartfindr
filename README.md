# smartfindr
A google chrome extention that is a smarter version of chrome's ctrl+f find-in-page feature by using IBM's Cloud Foundry API to host a Node.js server which contains a database of synonyms of words that can be fetched from in order to not only check the word typed into the search box but it's synonyms too, and IBM's Watson Cognitive Alchemy machine learning API to analyze the keywords on a given page and tell the user whether they're looking for information that is relevant in this page or not so that they know if they might be looking in the wrong place. The extention will also check to see if synonyms of the word match with Watson's results of keywords on the page.
